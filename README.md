## Executive Summary
This project will examine racial disparities in the application of sentencing guidelines in Tennessee from 2015 to 2019. First, I will look at sentencing records to identify rates of sentencing by race compared to the general population (per census records from the same time). Then I will examine average sentences by crime type to identify whether there are statistical disparities in sentences according to race. I will also examine the application of designations that increase sentences (such as armed career criminal status, career offender status, international terrorism status or repeat and dangerous sex offender status) to identify disparities.

## Motivation
I worked as a paralegal for 10 years and have always been very interested in the criminal justice system. I am also passionate about racial justice and believe that the criminal justice system plays a substantial role in ongoing racial inequity in America.

## Data Question
Here are my primary questions:
- Are there racial disparities in how likely a person is to be in the criminal justice system in Tennessee?
- Are there racial disparities in the application of federal sentencing guidelines in Tennessee?
<br><br>
Here is a website that looks at some of these issues: <br>

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
A presentation of 5-7 visualizations displaying the following findings:
- Determine the racial makeup of incarcerated persons in total and by crime type (drug-related, violent, property-related, etc.) from 2015 to 2019 in Tennessee
- Compare above racial makeup to overall population of those groups in Tennessee 
- Compare average sentences of racial groups to federal sentencing guidelines and identify disparities along these lines
- Examine application of special statuses, such as career offender or international terrorism, to identify gender or racial disparities.

## Known Issues and Challenges
- The sentencing data is in a platform called SAS, which I don’t have any familiarity with. (Resolved)
-	This project will require a good bit of background research on what federal sentencing guidelines are and how they work. The USSC has basically everything needed on their website, but there’s a lot of it. 
-	The sentencing data is incredibly complex (well over 1,000 columns, sometimes up to 30,000 columns) and categorizations/fields available have varied over time. It will be a challenge to identify the proper columns on which to base my analysis and there’s a large number of variables to consider.  
-	My audience and I are likely to have assumptions and biases around this data. It will be important to acknowledge these biases at the outset and take steps to avoid confirmation bias.
-	I’m afraid the scope of the project may be a little large. I may end up zeroing in on violent crime or drug crime in order to make my presentation a bit more focused, but I don’t want to narrow the scope until I’ve had more time to explore the data.
