## Executive Summary
This project examines racial and other disparities in the application of sentencing guidelines in Tennessee from 2015 to 2019. I examined 4 basic questions:
1. Are there racial disparities between the incarcerated population and the general population in Tennessee?
2. Are people of color receiving longer sentences on average for the same crimes?
3. Are there disparities in the application of sentence enhancements and sentence mitigation measures?
4. Is a person's sentence affected by whether they plead or go to trial?
<br><br>
## Motivation
I worked as a paralegal for 10 years and have always been very interested in the criminal justice system. I am also passionate about racial justice and believe that the criminal justice system plays a substantial role in ongoing racial inequity in America. 
<br><br>
## Key Findings
1. Black and Hispanic Tennesseans are incarcerated at a rate of 3.5x that of white Tennesseeans.
2. Black defendants are 40% less likely than white defendants to receive sentence reductions, but twice as likely to receive designations that substantially lengthen their sentences.
3. Defendants across racial lines receive sentences up to 100 years longer for nonviolent crimes than defendants who plead. This creates a strong incentive for defendants (regardless of race) to plead out rather than pursue their constitutional right to a trial by jury.
